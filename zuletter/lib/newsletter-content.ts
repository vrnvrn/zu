  content: `# Zuzalu Community Newsletter — 2024 Retrospective

Happy New Year's Eve, everyone! It's been a whirlwind of a year in the Zu-niverse, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

In this edition of the newsletter, you'll find some highlights – a portion of the energy and momentum our movement saw in 2024 – as well as upcoming events because no, we're not slowing down. ✊

I also think it's time to revamp the Zuzalu newsletter in the coming year. I've enjoyed keeping this mailing list alive with your submissions, and appreciate the surprising number of silent readers.

## Community Updates

### Communication Channels

**Note:** The "Zuzalu Official Announcements" channel from Montenegro (at least on my end) has no link for newcomers to subscribe to. Also worth considering a more open forum for sharing announcements in the new year.

## Looking Forward

Have a wonderful end to 2024, and see you in Zu next year!

🎉🍀💕
